ParticleUniverse
================

This project is a simple approach on a N-Body-Simulation.
It uses OpenCL for simulation and Gamestudio A8 for rendering.

Particles are able to crunch other particles, so they will "merge" into one single particle,
they are also able to attract particles with gravitation. Particles can be fixed into position
like a central star or similar.

For just checking out a demo, run the ParticleUniverse.exe in the Release folder.
